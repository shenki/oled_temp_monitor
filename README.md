= Temperature monitor

This sketch reads the temperature from a DHT22 temperature/humidity module and
displays the current temperature on a D1306 compatible 128x64 OLED LCD display.

It has been tested on a NodeMCU 1.0 with Arduino 1.6.9.

Note that the temperature sensor needed to be unpowered in order for
programming to succeed.
